## Project Description

This project is a task management application, designed to function as a Kanban board, allowing users to create, organize, and track their tasks efficiently. Developed with React, Zod, React Query, Express, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, the application demonstrates a strong grasp of both front-end and back-end technologies. Following Agile principles and the SCRUM methodology, I managed the entire development process, ensuring iterative progress and effective collaboration. This project showcases my ability to deliver high-quality software solutions in a dynamic, agile environment.
